Project Start Date : 1st Jan 2018\
Project End Date : 25th Jan 2018

The inspiration for this project was heavily inspired by the infotainment contents of Youtube channels such as CrashCourse, which aims to provide interesting information to the common public who aren't well articulated with certain fields such as arts, medicine, war, history and computer science.

As a computer science major, I and my team decided to take up human anatomy as the topic to get out of the comfort zone and experiment with what we can create against the tight deadline, culminating all our experiences of Unity Engine.

The presentation of our work was inspired by the anime "Cells at Work".
